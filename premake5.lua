-- We are now going to start defining the projects, where
-- each project builds some binary artifact (an executable,
-- library, etc.).
--
-- All of our projects follow a common structure, so rather
-- than reiterate a bunch of build settings, we define
-- some subroutines that make the configuration as concise
-- as possible.
--
-- First, we will define a helper routine for adding all
-- the relevant files from a given directory path:
--
-- Note that this does not work recursively 
-- so projects that spread their source over multiple
-- directories will need to take more steps.
function addSourceDir(path)
    files
    {
        path .. "/*.cpp",       -- C++ source files
        path .. "/*.h",         -- Header files
        path .. "/*.hpp",       -- C++ style headers (for glslang)
        path .. "/*.natvis",    -- Visual Studio debugger visualization files
    }
end

--
-- Next we will define a helper routine that all of our
-- projects will bottleneck through. Here `name` is
-- the name for the project (and the base name for
-- whatever output file it produces), while `sourceDir`
-- is the directory that holds the source.
--
-- E.g., for the `slang-llvm` project, the source code
-- is nested in `source/`, so we'd (indirectly) call:
--
--      baseroject("slang-llvm", "source/slang-llvm")
--
-- NOTE! This function will add any source from the sourceDir, *if* it's specified. 
-- Pass nil if adding files is not wanted.
function baseProject(name, sourceDir)

    -- Start a new project in premake. This switches
    -- the "current" project over to the newly created
    -- one, so that subsequent commands affect this project.
    --
    project(name)

    -- We need every project to have a stable UUID for
    -- output formats (like Visual Studio and XCode projects)
    -- that use UUIDs rather than names to uniquely identify
    -- projects. If we don't have a stable UUID, then the
    -- output files might have spurious diffs whenever we
    -- re-run premake generation.
    
    if sourceDir then
        uuid(os.uuid(name .. '|' .. sourceDir))
    else
        -- If we don't have a sourceDir, the name will have to be enough
        uuid(os.uuid(name))
    end

    -- Location could do with a better name than 'other' - but it seems as if %{cfg.buildcfg:lower()} and similar variables
    -- is not available for location to expand. 
    location("build/" .. slangUtil.getBuildLocationName(targetInfo) .. "/" .. name)

    -- The intermediate ("object") directory will use a similar
    -- naming scheme to the output directory, but will also use
    -- the project name to avoid cases where multiple projects
    -- have source files with the same name.
    --
    objdir("intermediate/" .. targetInfo.tokenName .. "/%{cfg.buildcfg:lower()}/%{prj.name}")
    
    -- All of our projects are written in C++.
    --
    language "C++"

    -- By default, Premake generates VS project files that
    -- reflect the directory structure of the source code.
    -- While this is nice in principle, it creates messy
    -- results in practice for our projects.
    --
    -- Instead, we will use the `vpaths` feature to imitate
    -- the default VS behavior of grouping files into
    -- virtual subdirectories (VS calls them "filters") for
    -- header and source files respectively.
    --
    -- Note: We are setting `vpaths` using a list of key/value
    -- tables instead of just a key/value table, since this
    -- appears to be an (undocumented) way to fix the order
    -- in which the filters are tested. Otherwise we have
    -- issues where premake will nondeterministically decide
    -- the check something against the `**.cpp` filter first,
    -- and decide that a `foo.cpp.h` file should go into
    -- the `"Source Files"` vpath. That behavior seems buggy,
    -- but at least we appear to have a workaround.
    --
    vpaths {
       { ["Header Files"] = { "**.h", "**.hpp"} },
       { ["Source Files"] = { "**.cpp", "**.slang", "**.natvis" } },
    }
    
    --
    -- Add the files in the sourceDir
    -- NOTE! This doesn't recursively add files in subdirectories
    --
    
    if not not sourceDir then
        addSourceDir(sourceDir)
    end
end


-- We can now use the `baseProject()` subroutine to
-- define helpers for the different categories of project
-- in our source tree.
--
-- For example, the Slang project has several tools that
-- are used during building/testing, but don't need to
-- be distributed. These always have their source code in
-- `tools/<project-name>/`.
--
function tool(name)
    -- We use the `group` command here to specify that the
    -- next project we create shold be placed into a group
    -- named "tools" in a generated IDE solution/workspace.
    --
    -- This is used in the generated Visual Studio solution
    -- to group all the tools projects together in a logical
    -- sub-directory of the solution.
    --
    group "tools"

    -- Now we invoke our shared project configuration logic,
    -- specifying that the project lives under the `tools/` path.
    --
    baseProject(name, "tools/" .. name)
    
    -- Finally, we set the project "kind" to produce a console
    -- application. This is a reasonable default for tools,
    -- and it can be overriden because Premake is stateful,
    -- and a subsequent call to `kind()` would overwrite this
    -- default.
    --
    kind "ConsoleApp"
end

-- "Standard" projects will be those that go to make the binary
-- packages the shared libraries and executables.
--
function standardProject(name, sourceDir)
    -- Because Premake is stateful, any `group()` call by another
    -- project would still be in effect when we create a project
    -- here (e.g., if somebody had called `tool()` before
    -- `standardProject()`), so we are careful here to set the
    -- group to an emptry string, which Premake treats as "no group."
    --
    group ""

    baseProject(name, sourceDir)
end

-- Finally we have the example programs that show how to use Slang.
--
function example(name)
    -- Example programs go into an "example" group
    group "examples"

    -- They have their source code under `examples/<project-name>/`
    baseProject(name, "examples/" .. name)

    -- Set up working directory to be the source directory
    debugdir("examples/" .. name)

    -- By default, all of our examples are console applications. 
    kind "ConsoleApp"
    
    -- The examples also need to link against the core slang library.
